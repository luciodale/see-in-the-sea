# 16° SEE IN THE SEA INTERNATIONAL UNDERWATER PHOTOCONTEST ORTONAMARE 2025

The contest is open to all underwater photographers and has a free theme. The contest is divided into the following sections:

### Wide Angle (WA)

Color images that must represent the underwater environment or its species using wide-angle optics or accessories. Long shots and backlighting are permitted, and a human presence can be included as a complementary element. The photographer is free to interpret the theme according to their own compositional style, using any technique. "Over-under" images are also allowed, provided the underwater portion is no less than 50%.

### Macro

Color images that must capture whole aquatic subjects or details of underwater life, highlighting the best aesthetic taste through compositional choices and colors. Images must be taken exclusively with macro lenses, excluding the use of fisheye lenses for close-up macro. Any technique is allowed, as long as the main subject of the image represents the theme.

### Black and White (B&W)

All free-theme images in black and white are allowed, whether shot with wide-angle or macro lenses.
